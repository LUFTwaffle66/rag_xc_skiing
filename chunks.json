However, adult data suggest that a reduc-\ntion in blood lactate accumulation during sub-\n maximal exercise following endurance training is \ndue to increased oxidative capacity in the exer-\ncising muscles [60, 61]. Alternatively, changes in \nlocomotion economy (the oxygen cost at a fixed \nlevel of sub- maximal exercise) following train-\ning might have clouded our understanding of the \ntraining- induced reduction in blood lactate accu-\nmulation during submaximal exercise.

More re-\ncently, Mahon [22] compared baseline peak V\u02d9 O2 \nwith training- induced percentage changes in \npeak V\u02d9 O2 from 21 studies of children and ado-\nlescents and concluded that there is a small but \nsignificant inverse relationship between the two \nvariables.", "Three of the tabulated studies directly ad-\ndressed this issue. Mandigout et al. [63] observed a \nsignificant negative relationship between baseline \npeak V\u02d9 O2 and percentage change in peak V\u02d9 O2 fol-\nlowing training. Tolfrey et al. [72] reported a simi-\nlar finding although in this case the relationship \naccounted for only 9% of the variance in peak V\u02d9 O2 \nover time and once the training- induced changes \nin peak V\u02d9 O2 were scaled to account for differenc-\nes in body size the changes were no longer sig-\nnificant. Rowland and Boyajian [64] observed no \nrelationship between pre- training peak V\u02d9 O2 and \ntraining response.", "As with all analyses reported here, one should \ncompare the results of studies using different \ntraining volumes with caution but analysis of the \n21 studies described in tables 1 and 2 reveals a \nsignificant negative relationship between pre-\n training peak V\u02d9 O2 and the training- induced per-\ncentage change in peak V\u02d9 O2 (fig. 2). This sug-\ngests that elite young athletes with higher baseline \nlevels of aerobic fitness are likely to experience \nsmaller percentage increases in peak V\u02d9 O2 follow-\ning training than young people less fit at the onset \nof a training programme.", "Pate and Ward [93] suggested that HPA might \nbe an important factor when assessing the influ-\nence of training on peak V\u02d9 O2 and others [95] \nhave proposed high levels of HPA as an explana-\ntion for blunted training responses in children.", "Two of the tabulated studies investigated the rela-\ntionship between HPA and changes in peak V\u02d9 O2.", "Tolfrey et al.

In contrast, Rowland and \nBoyajian [64] used a parent questionnaire to es-\ntimate HPA and reported a significant negative \nrelationship (r = \u2013 0.35) between level of HPA \nand percentage training- induced increase in \npeak V\u02d9 O2. However, in a more recent review, the \nsame author [96, p. 209] concluded that, \u2018the idea \nthat the higher HPA levels of children might \u2018pre-\ntrain\u2019 young subjects has been largely discounted.\u2019 \nEmpirical evidence shows that the view that HPA \nmight influence the effect of endurance training \n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n60\n65\n\u20135\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\nr = \u20130.432\nP = 0.015\nPre-training peak V\u00b7O2 (ml\u00b7kg\u20131\u00b7min\u20131)\nChange in peak V\u00b7O2 (%)\nFig. 2.

Data extracted from the studies \ndescribed in tables 1 and 2 show significant in-\ncreases in peak V\u02d9 O2 in 59% of male experimental \ngroups and 73% of female experimental groups.", "The average increase in peak V\u02d9 O2 with endur-\nance training is 6.7% (range \u2013 0.6 to 20.5%) in \nmale groups and 5.9% (range 0.7\u2013 9.3%) in female \ngroups. Five studies specifically investigated sex \ndifferences in peak V\u02d9 O2 responses to endurance \ntraining and concluded that training- induced \nchanges were independent of sex [63\u2013 65, 72, 78].", "Similar conclusions have been reached in earlier \nreviews of the extant literature [94, 99, 100].", "Age and Maturation Effects on the Peak V\u02d9O2 \nResponse to Endurance Training\nGilliam and Freedson [68] introduced an en-\nhanced physical education programme into the \nlifestyles of 8- year- olds over a period of 12 weeks \nand on observing no significant changes in a range \nof physiological variables including peak V\u02d9 O2 \nthey concluded that, \u2018a maturational threshold \nexists whereby pre- pubescent children are unable \nto elicit physiologic changes in response to exer-\ncise training\u2019 [p. 76]. Katch [101] subsequently \nproposed that there is one critical time period in \na child\u2019s life (a trigger point) below which the ef-\nfects of training will be minimal, or will not occur \nat all. He suggested that \u2018this trigger phenomenon \nis the result of modulating effects of hormones \nthat initiate puberty and influence functional de-\nvelopment and subsequent organic adaptations\u2019 \n[p. 241]. More recently, Rowland [102] re- visited \nKatch\u2019s trigger hypothesis, examined the extant", "velopment and subsequent organic adaptations\u2019 \n[p. 241]. More recently, Rowland [102] re- visited \nKatch\u2019s trigger hypothesis, examined the extant \ndata and concluded that although there are some \n\u2018tantalizing clues\u2019 that hormonal responses at pu-\nberty are critical for the enhancement of peak \nV\u02d9 O2 there are insufficient data to accept or reject \nthe trigger hypothesis.", "In a study which is often used to support the \ntrigger hypothesis, Kobayashi et al. [82] followed \na group of 7 boys from the age of 9.7 to 15.8 years \nand determined their peak V\u02d9 O2 annually. The \nboys trained for 1\u2013 1.5 h per day, four or five times \nper week throughout the period of observation al-\nthough the intensity of training was not report-\ned. Peak V\u02d9 O2 increased slowly until 1 year prior \nto peak height velocity (PHV) after which it was \nfound to increase above the normal amount at-\ntributable to age and growth. A major limitation \nof this study, however, was that measurements of \npeak V\u02d9 O2 for the control group did not begin un-\ntil after the age of PHV.", "In a conflicting report, Weber et al. [80] stud-\nied 12 pairs of identical twins, four sets aged \n10 years, four sets aged 13 years, and four sets \naged 16 years. One twin from each set followed a \n10- week training programme as outlined in table \n3. Significant changes in peak V\u02d9 O2 were observed \nin the 10- and 16- year- old twins but not in the \n13- year- olds. This was interpreted by the authors \nto demonstrate that children are less trainable \naround the age of puberty. In a similar investi-\ngation, Danis et al.

Introduction \n1.1 Cross-country skiing \n1.1.1 Competition formats in cross-country skiing \nCross-country (XC) skiing is a traditional Olympic winter sport, which has been on the \nOlympic program since the first Olympic winter games in Chamonix 1928. Since then, \nXC skiing has revolutionized extensively with average competition speeds almost \ndoubled over the last five decades due to the introduction of the skating technique in \nthe mid-1980s, as well as substantial improvements in skiing equipment, track \npreparations, as well as training and recovery methods [1-3]. These changes have been \naccompanied by the introduction of new events, such as the pursuit, mass-start, and \nsprint, posing different demands to XC skiers nowadays than for 50 years ago. Today, \nthe Olympic events in XC skiing for women and men include distance competitions of \n10- and 15-km individual time-trials (~25-35 min), 15- and 30-km pursuits (~40-80 min),", "10- and 15-km individual time-trials (~25-35 min), 15- and 30-km pursuits (~40-80 min), \nas well as 30- and 50-km mass-start competitions (~70-130 min) [4]. In addition, both \nsexes perform a distance relay (5- and 10-km for women and men, respectively) where \neach nation participate with four skiers. Moreover, the XC skiing sprint event was \nintroduced during the 1990s, and has been a part of the Olympic program since Salt \nLake City 2002, consisting of a qualifying time-trial (prologue) followed by three \nsubsequent knock-out heats performed over a ~1.3-1.8-km racecourse (~3 min \nduration) [4]. Lastly, a sprint relay has later been introduced, where each nation \ncompetes with two skiers on the same team, performing both a qualifying and a final \nround, consisting of six laps on a sprint racecourse with similar lengths as in the normal \nsprint event [4]. Today, both the individual sprint and sprint event is a part of the", "sprint event [4]. Today, both the individual sprint and sprint event is a part of the \nOlympic program together with the abovementioned distance competitions [4]. It \nshould also be emphasized that the XC skiing skating technique is used in the Olympic \nwinter sports, biathlon (6 events for men and women) and Nordic combined (3 events \nfor men) and thus, more than 25% of the medals (including 27 gold medals) were won \nby employing XC skiing techniques during the last Winter Olympics in Beijing [5, 6].", "2 \n \nFigure 1.

In this \ncontext, South Korea (PyeongChang) was selected as the host nation for the 2018 \nWinter Olympics, and China (Beijing) for the last Winter Olympics in 2022.

Their initial work has further led to a considerably high number of scientific \npublications in XC skiing over the last decades [2] and thus, increased our \nunderstanding of the competitive demands, as well as the optimal training methods \nand technical patterns in XC skiing [1, 2, 8]. Particularly in the Scandinavian countries, \nthe close collaboration between researchers and practitioners in XC skiing have likely \ncontributed to a training philosophy build on a strong theoretical framework.", "Therefore, it may be argued that the combination of retrospective training analyses of \nworld-class XC skiers practice together with more experimental designs have led to a \nwell-developed theoretical framework of endurance training in XC skiing (i.e. state-of-\nthe-art training methods). These training methods are described in a review on the \ncompetitive demands and training characteristics in XC skiing by Sandbakk and \nHolmberg 2017 [2].", "1.2 The physiological demands of cross-country skiing \nXC skiing is clearly among the most demanding endurance sports and involves \ncompetitions performed across varying terrain while changing between the different \nsub-techniques of the classical and skating technique. Consequently, XC skiing involves \n4 \nlarge fluctuations in both speed, work rate, and metabolic intensity while combining \nupper- and lower-body work to different extent [1, 2, 10]. Moreover, XC skiing \ncompetitions include different environmental conditions, requiring XC skiers to adapt \ntheir speed and pacing strategies to different snow conditions and competition \naltitudes (ranging from 0 to 1800 m) [4, 6, 11, 12]. Moreover, the equipment of XC \nskiers must be optimally adopted to both the XC skiers\u2019 anthropometrics and snow \nconditions [2]. Since 5 out of 6 Olympic events in XC skiing today involve \u201chead-to-\nhead\u201d competitions, tactical expertise and final sprint abilities are crucial performance", "head\u201d competitions, tactical expertise and final sprint abilities are crucial performance \ndeterminants. Taken together, XC skiing requires both high aerobic and anaerobic \nenergy turnover rates, strength, and speed, as well as technical and tactical expertise \n[1, 2, 10, 13].", "1.2.1 Energy demands, sub-techniques, and pacing strategies  \nEndurance performance is normally determined by the athlete\u2019s VO2 achieved during \nthe competition (i.e. performance VO2) combined with performance O2-deficit and \nwork economy/efficiency [14]. However, the physiological demands of XC skiing are \nunique compared to many endurance sports due to the constant fluctuations in speed \nand metabolic intensity during both training and competitions [10, 15-20]. XC skiing \nracecourses are designed to include approximately one-third uphill, one-third flat, and \none-third downhill terrain [4]. Here, around 50% of the racing time is spent uphill, \nwhereas ~35% and ~15% is spent in flat and downhill terrain, respectively. However, \nXC skiers typically spend only between ~10 to 70 sec per terrain section although longer \ntimes (~90-150 sec) may occur in some racecourses [10, 15, 17].

In fact, it has been demonstrated that \nXC skiers perform ~25 sub-technique transitions per km throughout the racecourse \n[21-23]. Here, the most common sub-techniques (also referred to as gears) are G2 (V1), \nG3 (V2), and G4 (V2a) in the skating technique, and diagonal (DIA), double-poling with \n5 \nkick (DPK), and double-poling (DP) in the classical technique. In addition, the tuck \nposition is used during downhill terrain sections at high speeds in both techniques.", "The uphill sections are regarded as the most performance-differentiating sections in \nXC skiing, although better performing skiers are typically faster in all sections compared \nto their lower-performing counterparts [20, 21, 24, 25]. However, it has also been \nsuggested that the uphill sections are more performance-differentiating among female \nXC skiers and that performance in flat and varied terrain are more differentiating \namong male XC skiers [26, 27]. In the uphill sections, XC skiers increase both work rate \nand metabolic intensity, whereas the subsequent downhill sections are primarily used \nfor recovery and the metabolic intensity is reduced (see Figure 2 for illustration). These \ninterval-based fluctuations in speed across varying terrain sections is referred to as \nmicro-pacing, although on a macro-level (lap-to-lap basis), XC skiers tend to employ a \npositive pacing strategy, with gradual reductions in speed throughout the competition", "positive pacing strategy, with gradual reductions in speed throughout the competition \n[12, 20, 22, 24, 25, 28]. However, the best performing skiers typically maintain speed \nbetter (more even pacing strategy) in comparison to their lower-performing peers, as \nconsistent with other endurance sports [12, 28, 29]. The requirements for higher \nintensity in uphill terrain in XC skiing drives metabolic demands considerably above \nthose required to elicit the maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max). This includes work rates \nas high as ~40% and ~15-20% above VO2max during the uphill sections in sprint and \ndistance XC skiing, receptively [15, 17, 30-33]. Therefore, XC skiing requires high \nanaerobic energy turnover rates (i.e. maximal accumulated oxygen deficit [\u03a3O2-deficit]) \nbut more importantly, the ability to recover during downhill sections and thereby \nreproduce anaerobic energy turnover [10, 18].

In addition to high VO2max values, the technically and physiologically demanding \nchanges between different sub-techniques in XC skiing requires a high development of \npeak oxygen uptakes (VO2peak) within all the main sub-techniques of the classical and \n7 \nskating technique [2, 39].

However, the highest \nVO2max values (~3% higher than running) are typically obtained in the classical DIA sub-\ntechnique where both the upper- and lower-body are involved in producing work [36, \n43]. Accordingly, XC skiers must target the development of high VO2peak/VO2max ratios, \nwhich might be more relevant in elite XC skiers, where further improvements in VO2max \nmay be limited [10]. Together with these maximal aerobic turnover rates, XC skiers \nmust develop high fractional utilizations of VO2max and VO2peak (i.e. performance VO2).", "In many endurance sports, the anaerobic threshold (maximal lactate steady state \n(MLSS) or critical speed/power) is considered an indirect measure of the athlete\u2019s \nfractional utilization during competitions [14, 44, 45], although it is not a valid measure \nof the fractional utilization in XC skiing due to the interval-based fluctuations in \nmetabolic intensity [2, 45].

However, more recent \ndevelopment of customized ski-specific treadmills has provided the opportunity to \ninvestigate mechanical efficiency (e.g. gross efficiency) in XC skiing due to more \naccurate calculations of work rate [53]. Here, gross efficiency is defined as the ratio of \nwork generated to the total energy expended (metabolic rate) [53]. Although there are \nconflicting viewpoints, previous studies have shown gross efficiency to be correlated \nwith performance in both sprint and distance XC skiing [52-56].

It should also be noted that relatively large between-athlete variations \nin training volume within different endurance sports are evident [81].", "1.3.2 Training intensity distribution  \nAlthough the volume and frequency of endurance training are rather straightforward \nto quantity, the intensity is more complex. Consequently, training intensity is typically \nquantified using different intensity zones based on measures of external (e.g. speed \nand power output) and/or internal load (e.g. heart rate [HR], blood lactate \nconcentrations [La\u2212], gas exchange, and rating of perceived exertion). While several \nintensity zones have been suggested and employed by different sport government \nbodies [82], a three-zone scale related to the first and second ventilatory threshold \nconcept (Figure 3) are commonly used in the scientific literature: low-intensity training \n(LIT, <2 mmol\u00b7L-1 [La\u2212] and 60-82% of maximal heart rate [HRmax]), moderate-intensity \ntraining (MIT, 2-4 mmol\u00b7L-1  [La\u2212] and 82-87% of HRmax) and high-intensity training (HIT, \n>4 mmol\u00b7L-1  [La\u2212] and >87% of HRmax) [62, 64, 82].

In their training process, most elite endurance \n10 \nathletes adopt a model consisting of high volumes of LIT combined with low- to \nmoderate amounts of MIT and/or HIT [61, 62, 64]. Therefore, specific training intensity \ndistribution models such as pyramidal (LIT>MIT>HIT), polarized (LIT>HIT>MIT), and \nthreshold (MIT>LIT>HIT) are most used among endurance athletes. However, the exact \ntraining intensity distribution seem to depend on the sport-specific demands, \nindividual requirements, as well as the phase of the annual training cycle [61, 64, 81].", "Accordingly, there are likely no optimal training intensity distribution that can be \nadopted both within and between different endurance sports, which has recently been \naddressed in two counterpoints on the polarized intensity distribution model [84, 85].", "In this context, endurance athletes often progress their overall training load \nthroughout the preparation period, which can be achieved either by increased volume \nLIT and/or volume MIT/HIT. High volumes of LIT is often seen as an important stimulus \nfor inducing peripheral adaptations such as increased mitochondrial biogenesis and \ncapillarization of the skeletal muscle [86, 87], whereas central adaptations such as \nincreased stroke volume of the heart, leading to improved VO2max, are regarded as \nmore responsive to intensification of the overall training stimulus [86-88]. However, \nthis dichotomous viewpoint is likely exaggerated as both LIT and HIT have many shared \nmolecular pathways (e.g. upregulating PGC-1\u03b1) and therefore elicits complex and \nintegrated adaptive signaling [61, 86].

In this context, valid methods for matching of \ntraining intensities and loads are required. However, most previous experimental \nstudies investigating the effects of different training intensities have used methods in \nwhich different intensities/loads have been matched for total work or oxygen \nconsumption (iso-energetic methods).

Hence, knowledge regarding the more subsequent effects of \ntraining interventions and particularly intensification studies in endurance athletes are \ncurrently lacking.", "1.3.4 Training periodization models \nThe structure and organization of endurance training is often referred to as training \nperiodization [94, 95], which involves different ordering of the training stimulus within \nmicro- (2-7 days), meso- (3-6 weeks), and macrocycles (6-12 months). Macrocycles can \nfurther be structured into general preparation period, specific preparation period and \ncompetition period [94, 95]. The term traditional periodization emphasizes high \ntraining volumes in the general preparation period, with a change towards more focus \non intensity, reduced volume, and more specific training in the specific preparation \nperiod [94-96]. This model has been adopted by many endurance athletes, \ndemonstrating high volumes of LIT combined with low-to-moderate amounts of MIT \nand/or HIT in the general preparation period, whereas the specific and/or competition \nperiod is often characterized by reduced volume and more intensified training (i.e.", "polarization) This periodization model is also supported by a recent training \nintervention study supporting the benefits of a pyramidal followed by a polarized \nintensity distribution over polarized followed by pyramidal or performing polarized or \na pyramidal intensity distribution alone during a 12-week intervention in trained \nrunners [97]. Coincided by the abovementioned changes in training intensity \ndistribution, elite endurance athletes often change their HIT stimulus from the general \n13 \npreparation to the specific preparation period [70, 98, 99]. This includes a higher \nfrequency of HIT sessions, often performed at a higher intensity closer to competition \nspeeds (i.e. increased specificity) with reduced duration.

Retrospective training analyses have \ndemonstrated that the annual training volumes of world-class XC skiers (~750-950 \nhours) consists of ~90% endurance training, and ~10% strength and speed training [2, \n39, 56, 76-78].

However, it is important to \nnote that these intensity distributions are averages values, and that both scientific and \nanecdotal evidence suggests that XC skiers balance training volume and intensity \nsomewhat different [77, 105, 106].

A follow-up study also presented data on the physiological responses to \nextensive HIT using different exercise modes over three annual cycles in 14 world-class \nfemale XC skiers [105].

The running is often performed in varied terrain \nand soft surfaces such as mountains and marshland. During the competition period, \nmost of the endurance training is performed as skiing combined with only small \namounts of running [2, 76, 78]. Alternations between several training modes (general \nand sport-specific) involving different loading of the upper- and lower-body might \nexplain the relatively high training volumes observed in XC skiers.

Consequently, world-class XC skiers perform ~2% speed training annually, \neither as single sessions or integrated into different LIT sessions. Moreover, XC skiers \nperform ~8% strength training including both core/stabilization exercises, and more \nstrength- and power-oriented exercises. However, the extent to which XC skiers \nprioritize strength/power training seem to vary extensively between XC skiers and are \nlikely more prioritized in sprint than distance XC skiers.

Such examples of \ntacit knowledge involve complex situations consisting of many elements, requiring the \nability to navigate, and understand the totality of the situation. In (elite) sports, it is \noften difficult to articulate all the knowledge and experience practitioners gain in the \nprocess of achieving world-class performances. Articulation of such knowledge can for \nexample be retrospective analyses of successful athletes training diaries and case \nstudies on the physiological profile of elite and world-class athletes. While such studies \nprovide valuable insights into the training characteristics of elite to world-class \nathletes, they are also limited by factors such as selection bias, ignoring the fact that \nmany athletes probably followed much of the same training without achieving the \nsame success [84]. Although most of this dissertation concerns quantitative data within \n22", "same success [84]. Although most of this dissertation concerns quantitative data within \n22 \nthe field of exercise physiology, qualitative assessments were additionally included in \nparts of the methodology (i.e. mixed-design) to gain complementary insights into the \ntraining and recovery process of athletes. Tacit knowledge is often developed through \nclose relationships and observations between athletes and coaches, and by athletes \nobserving the behavior of other athletes in a process where practical knowledge is \ntranslated into practice. For example, an athlete can gain tacit knowledge by purely \nobserving the coach or another athlete perform their skills (\"model learning\").", "Important tools in this process are observation, visualization, and imitation. \"Model \nlearning\" is a central part of (elite) sports and involves not only observation and \nimitation of technique, but all aspects of the training process (e.g. training content and \nquality). It may be argued that factors such as training quality explains much of the \nvariance between successful and less successful athletes although similar training is \nprescribed and carried out. However, such factors are often more difficult to articulate \nwhile retrospectively quantifying crucial factors in the training process of successful \nathletes.", "Over the last decades, there has been a clear trend for elite sports to work closer with \nacademia to develop more evidence-based knowledge. Quantitative methods are used \nto enhance performance through optimization of equipment, training, and recovery, \nas well as nutritional factors. However, research in elite sports does not necessarily \ncome without limitations. For the field of practice, such limitations may be the ability \nto read and understand scientific results. Therefore, \"translation\" of research findings \nto practice plays a crucial role while conducting applied research aiming to improve \n(elite) sports performance. Consequently, researchers should be good at \u201ctranslating\u201d \nand/or developing systems that \u201ctranslates\u201d research into relevant and applied \nknowledge for the practitioners. For example, in Norway, there are traditions for \n\u201ctranslating\u201d research findings to athletes and coaches through the sport government", "\u201ctranslating\u201d research findings to athletes and coaches through the sport government \nbody, Olympiatoppen. Over the last four decades, Olympiatoppen has worked closely \nwith different research institutions in Norway and played an important role in the \nprocess of translating research-based knowledge to elite sports. Another limitation of \n23 \nresearch in sports might be generalization of the research findings and bias that to \ndifferent extent influence the results. Most research in sport science only include data \non sub-elite athletes (i.e. more room for adaptations) and often exclusively on male \nparticipants, and it is therefore questionable to what extent much of the available \nliterature can be generalized to more elite populations and/or female participants.", "Moreover, research findings are often presented at a group level and the statistical \nresults (e.g. effects of an training intervention) does not necessarily apply to each \nindividual athlete although they provide important pieces to the knowledge puzzle. In \n(elite) sports, there are often large individual responses to training and other \ninterventions (e.g. recovery and nutritional strategies), and each individual athlete \nrepresents a unique case (n=1) and should be treated thereafter. In other words, study \nsamples in sport science research often constitute of multiple case studies. Therefore, \nresearch designs in elite sports including case studies and qualitative assessments may \nwork as complementary to quantitative analyses of larger study samples to better \nunderstand performance development at the individual level. Taken these limitations \ninto account, applied research on relevant aspects of elite sports can therefore not", "into account, applied research on relevant aspects of elite sports can therefore not \ndirectly guarantee that performances will improve. Performance development in elite \nsports is a complex phenomenon and there is much we do not understand today about \nthe mechanisms behind top sports performances. This is probably also the reason why \nintuition, experience, and tradition form the basis for training practice to a greater \nextent than the available scientific literature [116]. The results of scientific studies have \nprobably not affected practice in sports to the extent that we as researchers often \nbelieve [117]. However, on the other hand, evidence-based knowledge through high-\nquality research is of uttermost importance in several aspects of (elite) sports. Optimal \ninteraction between research and practice has clear positive effects, and possibly even \nbeyond what research or practice can achieve alone. The process of conducting", "beyond what research or practice can achieve alone. The process of conducting \nresearch often provide positive synergies and contributes to good and fruitful \ndiscussions between researchers and practitioners. This is done by challenging each \nother with mutual respect and over time creating a larger performance development \n24 \nthan what would have been possible without this interaction. However, the interaction \nbetween research and practice will of course depend somewhat on the research \ncarried out (e.g. basic vs. more applied research). A successful interaction between \nresearch and practice can be exemplified through the work that has developed the \npresent theoretical framework of training in XC skiing, and the work constituting this \ndissertation, conducting applied research on its own professional practice at a sport \nhigh school. This work has initiated fruitful discussions between researchers and", "high school.

Here, it has been experienced that to optimize the interaction \nbetween research and practice, researchers must perform applied work that has clear \nrelevance and contributes to increased knowledge for athletes and coaches. However, \nthere should also be room for more basic studies on aspects relevant for sports, as such \nquestions are important parts of the knowledge puzzle. Moreover, practitioners must \nclarify what questions and knowledge gaps they are facing in their daily work as \nathletes and coaches. Here, it is important that researchers recognize and \nacknowledge aspects of professional practice such as tacit knowledge, as well as the \nmulti-dimensional parts of the athletes training and development process. This", "multi-dimensional parts of the athletes training and development process. This \nexemplifies the complexity of the training and recovery process, where often only one \nfactor is isolated and investigated in research studies.

Researchers must further use high-quality methods to answer these research \nquestions. Here, the combination of quantitative and qualitative designs might provide \ncomplementary understanding of the complexity of training and performance \ndevelopment.

Their views on training load and quality, \nrate of injury and illness, physiological and technical development, as well as \npsychological and/or sociological differences between high- and low-responders were \nexamined. All interviews were conducted face-to-face and tape-recorded in their \nentirety before being transcribed and analyzed. For these data, a content analysis was \nconducted independently by two researchers. All coaches volunteered for the study \nand signed an informed consent prior to their participation.

These individual response \nmagnitudes were summarized in three different categories: nonresponse defined as \n\u22640% change, moderate response as 0% to 5% change, and large response as \u22655% \nchange.

Between-group \ndifferences in baseline and training characteristics were tested using an independent-\nsamples t-test in combination with Mann-Whitney U test. To test for significant PRE- \nto POST changes within groups, paired-samples t-test were applied and Wilcoxon \nsigned rank test when data deviated from normally distribution.

The main findings \nwere as follows: \nStudy I) Both increased load of LIT and HIT during the 8-week intervention period \nelicited significant performance adaptations such as improved uphill running time-trial \nperformance and peak speed when incremental running and roller-ski skating to \nexhaustion in the laboratory during the preparation period of junior XC skiers.", "However, there were no significant differences between groups in performance \nadaptations, although increased HIT elicited 3-4% greater improvements in VO2max \nrunning and VO2peak roller-ski skating compared to increased LIT.", "Study II) The superior increase in VO2max running and VO2peak roller-ski skating in the \ngroup increasing HIT during the 8-week intervention period were outbalanced \nfollowing a subsequent 5-week training period consisting of similar training regimes \nand intensity distributions. Moreover, no further changes in any performance or \nphysiological indices in roller-ski skating neither within nor between the two \nintervention groups were found 14 weeks later in the competition period.", "Study III) The 6-month talent transfer period elicited large improvements in \nperformance indices during roller-ski skating and double-poling ergometry, whereas \nperformance indices in running were unchanged. These changes were coincided with \nimproved efficiency/work economy and longer cycle lengths during roller-ski skating, \nas well as improved 1RM upper-body strength. However, no changes in VO2max running \nand VO2peak roller-ski skating and double-poling ergometry were found at a group level.", "Moreover, larger performance improvements in roller-ski skating and double-poling \n54 \nergometry were found in athletes originating from running compared to \nkayaking/rowing.", "Study IV) High performance-responders to the 6-month training period demonstrated \nsuperior physiological adaptations both at submaximal and maximal workloads (i.e.", "VO2max running and VO2peak roller-ski skating) than their low-responding counterparts.", "These findings were coincided with higher training loads, greater perceived effort \nduring sessions, and lower incidents of injury and illness in high- compared to low-\nresponders. Moreover, qualitative assessments of the athletes coaches highlighted \nthat greater motivation and passion for XC skiing together with the ability to build a \nstrong coach-athlete relationship separated high- from low-responders.", "6.1 Study I-II \nStudies I-II investigated two different approaches to the theoretical framework of \nendurance training in XC skiing [2]. The 8-week intervention period (study I) per se was \nregarded as successful because most athletes improved their performance (~60% \ndemonstrated moderate- to large performance responses). However, no significant \ndifferences in any performance adaptations were found between the intervention \ngroups, although the distribution of individual response magnitudes indicated some \nmore positive performance adaptations in the group increasing HIT. Therefore, the \nstatistical findings in study 1 were somewhat in contrast to those previously reported \nby St\u00f6ggl and Sperlich [129] and Vesterinen et al. [130], who demonstrated superior \nperformance adaptations of a more polarized intensity distribution with greater \nintensification (i.e. HIT stimulus) compared to high-volume LIT. Moreover, the findings", "intensification (i.e. HIT stimulus) compared to high-volume LIT. Moreover, the findings \nwere in contrast to the well-cited study by Helgerud et al. [88], demonstrating the \nsuperiority of HIT on indices of endurance performance using an iso-energetically \nmatched method in a group of non-athletes. However, Ingham et al. [131] and Nuuttila \net al. [132] found similar performance adaptations of both high-volume LIT and HIT \nregimes, which is consistent with the present findings and implies that similar \nperformance progression can successfully be achieved both by increased load of LIT \n55 \nand HIT during the preparation period in XC skiers. This is further supported by a recent \ncase study on the most successful female XC skier of all time, employing two different \nintensity distributions and periodization models during her career (i.e. extensive HIT-\nblock periodization vs. more LIT focus and traditional periodization) [77], as well as", "block periodization vs. more LIT focus and traditional periodization) [77], as well as \nmore anecdotal evidence indicating individual variations in how XC skiers balance their \ntraining volume and intensity during the preparation period.", "The tendencies for better performance adaptations in HITG during the intervention \n(distribution of individual response magnitudes) were outbalanced by within-group \nperformance improvements in LITG during the subsequent 5-week training period \n(study II). Accordingly, intensification during this period had positive performance \neffects in LITG, although it remains unknown whether these improvements were \ncaused by adopting more HIT per se or by the change from prioritizing high-volume LIT \nto more intensified training (i.e. traditional periodization model), which may elicit \ncomplementary adaptive responses [62, 64]. In comparison, performance indices did \nnot change in HITG during the subsequent 5-week training period, which are likely \nexplained by already maximized intensification-effects during the 8-week intervention.", "These findings are consistent with a previous study by Sylta et al. [98] who found that \nmost training adaptations elicited by intensification occurred already within the first 4 \nweeks of a 12-week  intervention, investigating the effects of different HIT ordering \nand its adaptation time course in well-trained cyclists. However, it should be noted that \nthe performance adaptations elicited during the 8-week intervention in HITG were \nmaintained despite reduced volume of HIT in the subsequent training period.", "During the 14-weeks of self-chosen training in the competition period (study II), no \nfurther changes in performance indices neither within- nor between the intervention \ngroups were found. These findings agree with a previous study in elite male XC skiers \n[133], where most improvements in performance and physiological indices occurred \nduring the preparation period, with only minor changes in the competition period.", "These findings were, however, in contrast to a study with comparable design \n56 \nconducted among well-trained cyclists, demonstrating positive effects of \nimplementing HIT during an 8-week intervention in the transition period on \nperformance indices 16 weeks into the subsequent preparation period [134]. Yet, \nthese conflicting findings are likely explained by differences between implementing \nmore HIT in the transition period where the overall training load is reduced vs. in the \npreparation period with higher training loads. Altogether, these findings indicate that \ndifferences in performance adaptations elicited by a typical short-term training \nintervention (8 weeks) had little or no effects on the development of performance \nindices in subsequent training periods.", "Coincided with the abovementioned performance adaptations, increased load of HIT \nelicited superior physiological adaptations (3\u20134% increases in VO2max running and \nroller-ski skating) compared to increased load of LIT during the intervention period \n(study I). These findings were further strengthened by better distribution of individual \nresponse magnitudes in VO2max/VO2peak, as well as better physiological adaptations at \nsubmaximal workloads in HITG. Therefore, it seems obvious that the superior \nphysiological adaptations in HITG had a positive effect on performance adaptations in \nstudy I. However, the reasons for improved performance in LITG without improving \nVO2max could be explained by increased fractional utilization. The superior VO2max \nadaptations in HITG are likely explained by increased O2 delivery capacity [86, 87, 93], \nwhich are supported by other short-term training intensification studies [88, 90, 91].", "These findings implies that even when matching training intensities with a more \necologically valid method as employed in study I, a sufficient HIT stimulus seems \nneeded to overload the cardiovascular system sufficiently and thereby increase VO2max \nmore than when compensating with increased load of LIT [86, 93]. Altogether, \nprogressing the overall training stimulus by intensification seems favorable if the goal \nis to elicit VO2max adaptations over a relatively short training period in XC skiers. These \nfindings agree with retrospective analyses of XC skiers training emphasizing HIT in their \npreparation period with the goal of maximizing aerobic energy turnover capacities [76, \n77, 105]. However, no statistical differences in any physiological adaptations neither at \n57 \nsubmaximal nor maximal workloads (TTE tests) were found between LITG and HITG \nafter the subsequent 5 weeks with similar training regimes and after 14 weeks of self-", "after the subsequent 5 weeks with similar training regimes and after 14 weeks of self-\nchosen training in the competition period (study II). Accordingly, the subsequent 5-\nweek period with similar intensity distribution across groups, and thereby \nintensification for LITG, outbalanced the superior VO2max adaptations obtained by HITG \nduring the preceding 8-week intervention period.", "Interestingly, a considerably lower HIT stimulus during the 5-week training period \nelicited somewhat similar VO2peak adaptations when roller-ski skating in LITG compared \nto the effects achieved by HITG during the more intensive 8-week intervention. These \nfindings may suggest a \u201cceiling-effect\u201d, with an upper limit for how much HIT that is \nneeded to maximize VO2max adaptations in already well-trained endurance athletes.", "This hypothesis is partly supported by Billat et al. [135] who found that intensification \nbeyond 1 HIT and 1 MIT session per week elicited no further adaptations but instead \nincreased markers of maladaptation. Therefore, the present data suggests that \nalthough ~1 HIT and ~1 MIT session per week might be sufficient to maintain VO2max \nvalues, ~2-3 weekly HIT sessions are likely needed to maximize VO2max and other \nphysiological adaptations over short time periods in endurance athletes. However, the \nvolume and intensity within these intensity domains can vary extensively between \nsessions and adaptive responses from HIT and/or MIT are also dependent on optimal \ninteraction between intensity and total work duration per session [136, 137]. In \naddition, the intensification-effects on VO2max in studies I-II occurred within a relatively \nshort time frame which agrees with the findings by Sylta et al. [98]. Lastly, it should be", "short time frame which agrees with the findings by Sylta et al. [98]. Lastly, it should be \nnoted that the VO2max adaptations were only trivial to small within both groups (ES, \n0.1-0.3), which are somewhat lower than those found in comparable training \nintervention studies [98, 138]. The reason for this is not known but are most likely \nrelated to differences in athletes training status, duration of the intervention, and the \ntraining prescribed.", "58 \nIt should also be emphasized that large inter-individual differences in training \nadaptations were found in studies I-II despite using a more ecologically valid approach \nwith individual adjustments of load, which differed from most previous training \ninterventions using similar load prescriptions. Overall, these findings provide \ncomplementary insights to retrospective training analyses of successful XC skiers, by \ndemonstrating large individual responses to the theoretical framework of endurance \ntraining in XC skiing. In study I, the individual response magnitudes revealed that some \nathletes in LITG also increased VO2max to the same extent as HITG, indicating individual \nvariations in how athletes respond to different endurance training intensities in \neliciting physiological adaptations [100, 130]. This may in part be explained by \nbetween-athlete variations in adaptive signaling and stress tolerance to LIT and HIT", "between-athlete variations in adaptive signaling and stress tolerance to LIT and HIT \ntraining. In addition, the present sample of athletes, including both sexes and different \ninitial levels, could in part have contributed to the subsequent variations in training \nresponses. However, the groups were matched for sex, physiological indices, and \ntraining characteristics pre-intervention, and baseline values were adjusted for as a \ncovariate in the statistical analysis. Although the individual training responses were \nmore equally distributed in study II, large individual responses were still evident, \nindicating that XC skiers respond different to different training intensities and \nperiodization models. Accordingly, individualized training intensity distributions and \nperiodization models (i.e. choosing the right method to the right athlete at the right \ntime) are likely important to optimize long-term performance development in XC \nskiing.", "In studies I-II, a more ecologically valid method than most previous training \nintervention studies was employed. In these studies, endurance training intensities \n(loads) have been matched for total work or oxygen consumption (i.e. iso-energetic \nmethod) [88, 90, 91]. The methodological approach in study I was based on the TRIMP \nmethod for matching of training intensity and induced a similar increase in overall \nTRIMP load in both intervention groups during the 8-week intervention [139, 140].", "Accordingly, a significant between-group difference in LIT and HIT load was achieved \n59 \nwhile obtaining similar overall training loads. Moreover, study II investigated the \nsubsequent effects of the 8-week intervention on performance and physiological \nindices following a 5-week standardized training period with similar training intensity \ndistribution across groups, and thereafter 14 weeks of self-chosen training and \ncompetitions. This approach differs from most previous training intervention studies \nwhere data on the interventions influence on the subsequent training periods or \neffectiveness of the interventions over longer time spans are lacking. Accordingly, the \nmethodological approach in studies I-II provides novel data on both the short-term and \nmore subsequent effects of load progression using different training intensity \ndistributions during the preparation period in XC skiing.", "6.2 Studies III-IV \nStudies III-IV provide unique data on a talent transfer process where athletes \noriginating from different endurance sports (running and kayaking/rowing) were \ntransferred to XC skiing by using the theoretical framework of endurance training in XC \nskiing (i.e. state-of-the-art training methods [2]) while aiming for participation in the \nBeijing 2022 Olympics. In fact, this was achieved by two of the athletes in the program, \nparticipating in several of the XC skiing events during the Beijing Olympics. Although \nsome literature on individuals [112] and groups [113, 114] transferring from one sport \nto another exist, study III was the first study to investigate the development of \nperformance, physiological, and technical indices among athletes transferring between \nendurance sports. Here, large performance improvements in sport-specific modes \nsuch as roller-ski skating and double-poling ergometry were found, whereas no", "such as roller-ski skating and double-poling ergometry were found, whereas no \nperformance changes were found in a general mode as running. The magnitude of \nperformance improvement found between modes was clearly related to their technical \ncomplexity, where roller-ski skating demonstrated largest performance improvement \ndue to more sport-specific and complex technical requirements compared to double-\npoling ergometry and running (i.e. higher initial level and less room for adaptations).", "These findings indicate that understanding differences between the performance and \n60 \nphysiological adaptations in general vs. sport-specific modes might be of particular \nimportance in the process of transferring athletes between sports that requires new \nand complex technical demands.", "Coincided with the abovementioned performance changes, maximal aerobic turnover \nrates (i.e. VO2max/VO2peak) did not change significantly in either of the exercise modes \nexamined after the 6-month training period (study III). This was not unexpected in \nrunning among these already endurance-trained athletes with the majority of athletes \noriginating from running but were more unexpected in roller-ski skating and double-\npoling ergometry.

These \nstrength adaptations corresponded with improvements in cycle length and gross \nefficiency during submaximal roller-ski skating which probably enhanced the athlete\u2019s \nability to improve sport-specific performance independent of changes in maximal \naerobic energy turnover rates. Such improvements in technique-specific strength and \n61 \npropulsion have previously been associated with longer cycle lengths and better work \neconomy/efficiency in XC skiers [2, 53]. Accordingly, the findings from study III suggests \nthat the development of performance indices during both roller-ski skating and double-\npoling were most likely explained by improved sport-specific strength and power, \nleading to better technique-specific propulsion.

These findings were coincided with a 5% increase \nin VO2peak, that were significantly different from the unchanged VO2peak values roller-\nski skating among those athletes with a background from kayaking and rowing.", "Runners also demonstrated a tendency towards improved VO2max in running (moderate \nES). However, no between-group differences in the development of cycle length, skiing \nefficiency, or 1RM upper-body strength were revealed. This could possibly imply that \ndespite having similar potential for developing technical and strength/power abilities \nin both groups, the runners were more likely to respond physiologically positive to XC \nski-specific training by eliciting adaptations that improves maximal aerobic energy \nturnover. These findings were further supported by the findings in study IV, where \nmost of the high responders had a sport background from middle- and long-distance \nrunning. The underlying mechanisms for the observed differences between runners \nand kayakers/rowers in sport-specific performance improvement are not known but \nimply overall lower adaptive responses among kayakers/rowers.

This might be \n62 \nexplained by a lower tolerance for high loads of endurance training in a new mode, \npossibly leading to maladaptation and negative training outcomes. Moreover, the \nrunners might have been more familiar with the main exercise modes being utilized \nsince a large amount of running was performed (30% of all endurance training), and \nclassical skiing involves movements more closely related to the movement patterns of \ntheir sports background.", "In study IV, the athletes classified as high-performance responders (i.e. overall largest \nperformance development the modes investigated) improved their VO2max running and \nVO2peak roller-ski skating, whereas the low-performance responders displayed small \nreductions of these physiological indices over the 6-month training period. Better \nphysiological adaptations among high-responders were additionally coincided with \nlarger improvements in power output at 4 mmol\u00b7L-1 and more reduced physiological \ncost at the same submaximal workload roller-ski skating. However, the development \nof efficiency and cycle length did not differ between groups and were largely improved \nin both high- and low-responders. This is most likely explained by the low initial levels \nof both skiing efficiency and cycle length among these highly unexperienced skiers.", "Accordingly, there was a large potential for improving efficiency and cycle length \namong all athletes. Overall, these findings demonstrate that the high responders were \nable to concurrently develop their maximal/peak aerobic turnover rates together with \ngross efficiency and cycle length. This ability is highly important as both skiing efficiency \nand VO2max/VO2peak are crucial performance determinants in XC skiing [2]. The largest \ndifference in performance and physiological adaptations between the two groups of \nresponders were found in roller-ski skating, indicating that differences in technical \ndevelopment could have influenced the greater performance development in high-\nresponders. Although the development of cycle length during treadmill roller-ski \nskating did not differ between groups, the coaches perceived that the high-responders \nclearly developed their on-snow technical skills to a larger extent than low-responders", "clearly developed their on-snow technical skills to a larger extent than low-responders \n(study IV). Thus, more sophisticated measures (e.g. sub-technique selection and \n63 \nkinematical patterns) than those included in our approach may have better detected \nthese differences in technical development.", "The difference in training volume between high- and low-responders during the 6-\nmonth period was only 6%, but the largest relative difference was found in the \namounts of MIT and HIT performed (~8% difference). Since this training is suggested \nto provide effective stimuli for the development of VO2max (as supported by the findings \nin study I), it may have contributed to the larger developments of maximal aerobic \nenergy turnover rates among high-responders [141, 142]. In addition, the greater \nperceived effort during sessions found in high-responders could imply a higher \nmotivation to maintain training effort during sessions and/or better ability to push \nthemselves. This higher training tolerance might have elicited a greater overload \nstimulus and subsequently elicited better physiological adaptations through a larger \nexternal load (e.g. average speed or distance) during sessions in high-responders. The", "external load (e.g. average speed or distance) during sessions in high-responders. The \nlack of physiological adaptations in low-responders are most likely caused by a lower \ntraining tolerance, possibly leading to maladaptation and states of non-functional \noverreaching in some of the athletes. This is further supported by the qualitative \nassessments of the athlete\u2019s coaches, who reported that low-responders had less \ncontinuity in their training and more days of injury/illness. Furthermore, the coaches \nfound it particularly challenging to find the optimal training load among low-\nresponders who also struggled to perceive and communicate the load-recovery \nbalance to their coaches [143]. These findings highlight the importance of finding the \noptimal balance between load and recovery, while maintaining good health and \navoiding injury and illness, to achieve long-term performance development in XC", "avoiding injury and illness, to achieve long-term performance development in XC \nskiing. In addition, other factors than those measured in our design (e.g. nutrition, \nsleep quantity and quality, and genetic influence) could have contributed to explain \nparts of the observed variance in training responses between the two groups of \nresponders in study IV [100].", "64 \nThe athlete\u2019s personal coaches reported motivation, passion, and a strong coach-\nathlete relationship to be the most important factors associated with a high-training \nresponse during the 6-month period in study IV. While these factors might have an \nindependent influence on athlete development, their impact might also be \ninterrelated. A strong coach-athlete relationship between high-responders and their \nrespective coaches may have played an important role in optimizing the individual \ntraining loads and thereby positively influenced the performance and physiological \nadaptations of these athletes. However, a strong coach-athlete relationship might also \nhave positively influenced the athletes\u2019 motivation and passion and vice-versa, and \nthereby reinforce the positive performance-development. For example, maintenance \nof motivation throughout the entire training period in high-responders might have", "of motivation throughout the entire training period in high-responders might have \ncontributed to their greater training effort and thus induced a larger overload stimulus \nand physiological development. Furthermore, higher passion for the training process \nand general well-being among high-responders might have enhanced the tolerance for \nand recovery from high training loads. In contrast, a less strong coach-athlete \nrelationship combined with reduced performance-development in low-responders \nmight have induced an imbalance between overall stress and recovery. Overall, these \nfindings emphasize key psychological and sociological factors that coaches should \nconsider when optimizing training adaptations and performance development in \nendurance athletes.

However, because of the\ntechnical complexity of XC skiing, sport-speci\ufb01c peak oxygen\nuptakes (VO2peak) above 90% of VO2max combined with high\nfractional utilization of VO2peak in all the main sub-techniques\nin classical and skating are additionally considered as important\ncapacities in modern XC skiing (Sandbakk and Holmberg, 2017).", "In addition, sport-speci\ufb01c performance in the laboratory (e.g.,\ntime to exhaustion and peak speed) during treadmill roller-skiing\nusing both skating and classical techniques has repeatedly been\nassociated with on-snow performance (Sandbakk et al., 2011a,\n2016b) and used to distinguish skiers on di\ufb00erent performance\nlevels (Sandbakk et al., 2011b, 2016a).", "Furthermore, XC skiers must e\ufb00ectively convert metabolic\nenergy into external work rate and speed, and thus, gross\ne\ufb03ciency has been shown to be a key determinant of performance\nin both sprint and distance XC skiing (Sandbakk et al.,\n2010, 2011b, 2012, 2013; Ainegren et al., 2013). In addition,\nbetter performing skiers often demonstrate a skiing technique\nwith longer cycle lengths and lower cycle rates, indicating\nbetter technique-speci\ufb01c propulsion that could possibly explain\nvariations in work economy and skiing e\ufb03ciency (Sandbakk\net al., 2010; Sandbakk and Holmberg, 2017). Clearly, an adequate\nlevel of both upper- and lower-body strength and power are\nneeded to produce and transfer these forces e\ufb03ciently. Especially\nin sprint XC skiing, maximal strength within movement-speci\ufb01c\nexercises as well as upper-body power have previously been\nshown to be correlated with performance (St\u00f6ggl et al., 2007).", "The training of XC skiers targets a concurrent development of\nthe abovementioned capacities, with training programs especially\ndesigned to facilitate long-term development of aerobic energy\ndelivery and skiing e\ufb03ciency (Holmberg, 2015; Sandbakk and\nHolmberg, 2017). Today, world-class XC skiers perform an\nannual training volume of approximately 750\u2013950 h, with 90%\nbeing endurance training with a polarized intensity distribution\n(Sandbakk and Holmberg, 2017), whereas 10% is performed as\nstrength and speed training (T\u00f8nnessen et al., 2014; Sandbakk\nand Holmberg, 2017; Solli et al., 2017).

The greater\nperformance and endurance adaptations in high-responders\nwere associated with higher training volumes (363 vs. 344 h),\ntraining loads (3825 vs. 3228), load/volume ratios (5 vs.", "4) and lower incidents of injury and/or illness (5 vs. 10\ndays) in comparison to low-responders. In addition, qualitative\ninterviews with their coaches highlighted that greater motivation\ntogether with the ability to build a strong coach-athlete\nrelationship separated high- from low-responders.", "Development of Physiological and\nTechnical Capacities\nHigh-responders improved their running-VO2max and VO2peak\nin roller-ski skating, whereas low-responders displayed small\nreductions of these capacities over the 6 months of XC ski-speci\ufb01c\nendurance training. These changes were accompanied by larger\nimprovements in power output at 4 mmol\u00b7L\u22121 and had reduced\nphysiological strain at a given speed when submaximal roller-\nski skating among high-responders. In contrast, the development\nof skiing e\ufb03ciency and cycle length did not di\ufb00er between-\ngroups and were largely improved in both high- and low-\nresponders. This is most likely explained by the low initial levels\nof both skiing e\ufb03ciency and cycle length among these highly\nunexperienced skiers. Hence, there was a large potential for\nimproving e\ufb03ciency and cycle length among all athletes, while\nonly high-responders were able to concurrently improve their\nenergy delivery capacity (i.e., VO2max and VO2peak). Overall,", "only high-responders were able to concurrently improve their\nenergy delivery capacity (i.e., VO2max and VO2peak). Overall,\nthese \ufb01ndings demonstrate that high-responding transfer athletes\ncan simultaneously develop their maximal/peak physiological\ncapacities together with skiing e\ufb03ciency and cycle length. This\nability is highly important as concurrent development in both\ne\ufb03ciency and VO2max/peak is required for these athletes to\nreach the highest level in XC skiing (Sandbakk and Holmberg,\n2017).
