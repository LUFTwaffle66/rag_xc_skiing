  "vilda": "Vilda is 18 years old and races in the junior category. His main focus is cross-country skiing, followed by ski orienteering. He casually participates in orienteering during the summer. He prefers training that is steady and structured, even if it leaves him slightly fatigued \u2013 this tends to improve his race performance. He benefits from regular strength training year-round and feels his best after a block of training, followed by a few easier days before competition. Vilda performs well with volume early in the season, but also needs speed work to stay sharp. He prefers focused sessions over high-volume for the sake of volume, and morning intervals are most effective for him. He\u2019s highly affected by school, which drains his energy more than the training itself. A low resting heart rate during busy school periods is a good sign of form for him. He monitors HR closely, and spikes in the middle of the week usually indicate something's wrong. Too many races close together can leave him drained. He values recovery, but prefers to go into races slightly fatigued. Before breakfast, he prefers light warm-ups rather than real workouts. His best taper includes a training camp, then a few light days before race day. He sometimes trains alone or with two close friends. He wants to improve in sprint performance and skate distance races.",
  "david": "David wants to improve his sprinting ability and often monitors his physical state closely out of concern for getting sick \u2013 though he sometimes overthinks minor symptoms. He excels in long-distance races, especially in classic technique, but is also strong in skate events. His strengths lie in sustained effort and strategic pacing. Mentally, he needs confidence in his health to fully commit to performance. He benefits from clear race goals and varied training that balances intensity with confidence-building.",
  "kuchy": "Kuchy aims to improve his classic skiing technique and overall performance in longer races. He is a strong tempo skier and performs best in long-distance events, especially when racing against others. Although his strength is in steady pacing, he is also comfortable skating and can hold good speed over time. He responds well to well-structured training weeks and tends to excel when he knows what\u2019s coming in advance."
